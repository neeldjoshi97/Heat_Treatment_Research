# ðŸ”¥ Heat Treatment Research â€“ Undergraduate Study

This repository presents the findings and methodology of my undergraduate research on heat treatment processes applied to **Low Carbon Medium Alloy Steels**. The study focuses on three primary heat treatment techniques â€” **Normalisation**, **Annealing**, **Hardening** and **Spheroidisation** â€” as well as various combinations thereof. The final results have been published in a peer-reviewed research paper.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Heat treatment plays a critical role in tailoring the mechanical properties of metals and alloys. This research investigates how different heat treatment methods influence microstructure, hardness, ductility, and overall performance of steel samples.

### Techniques Studied

- **Normalisation**: Heating above the critical temperature followed by air cooling to refine grain structure.
- **Annealing**: Controlled heating and slow cooling to relieve internal stresses and improve ductility.
- **Hardening**: Heating above critical temperature followed by water quenching to get martensitic structure.
- **Spheroidisation**: Prolonged heating near the critical temperature to produce spherical carbides for enhanced machinability.
- **Combinations**: Sequential and hybrid treatments to explore synergistic effects.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- **Material Used**: Medium Carbon Low Alloy Steel (EN08 and EN24)
- **Experimental Setup**: Muffle furnace, metallographic preparation, hardness testing
- **Characterization Techniques**:
  - Optical microscopy
  - Rockwell hardness testing
  - Microstructural analysis

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

- Normalisation improved grain uniformity and moderate hardness.
- Annealing enhanced ductility but reduced hardness.
- Spheroidisation yielded excellent machinability with minimal hardness.
- Combined treatments revealed nuanced trade-offs between strength and ductility.
